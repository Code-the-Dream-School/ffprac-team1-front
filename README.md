## Technologies Used

Our front-end is powered by a suite of modern tools and libraries to ensure a responsive, efficient, and visually appealing user experience:

- **Core Frameworks:**
  - `React` - A JavaScript library for building user interfaces, ensuring a reactive and component-based architecture.
  - `React DOM` - Serves as the entry point to the DOM and server renderers for React.

- **Routing and Navigation:**
  - `React Router Dom` - Enables dynamic routing in a web app, which is critical for single-page applications.

- **HTTP Requests:**
  - `Axios` - Promise-based HTTP client for making requests to back-end services.

- **UI Components and Design:**
  - `@material-tailwind/react` and `daisyui` - Provide prebuilt Material Design components and utilities for rapid UI development.
  - `@heroicons/react`, `react-slick`, and `slick-carousel` - Offer a collection of accessible SVG icons and a carousel component for creating sliders in React apps.

- **Styling and CSS Frameworks:**
  - `Tailwind CSS` - A utility-first CSS framework for rapid UI development.

- **Development and Build Tools:**
  - `Vite` - A modern front-end build tool that provides a faster and leaner development experience.
  - `ESLint` - Linting utility for JavaScript and JSX, with plugins for React-specific linting.
  - `Prettier` - An opinionated code formatter to ensure code style consistency.

## Development Scripts

- **Start and Develop:** `npm run start` or `npm run dev` to start the development server on port 3000.
- **Build:** `npm run build` to compile the application for production deployment.
- **Lint:** `npm run lint` to check the code for any linting errors.
- **Preview:** `npm run preview` to locally preview the production build.

This setup leverages cutting-edge technologies and tools to streamline development workflows and enhance the performance of the application.
